You are received a link to this letter, because I, or someone who I trust thinks that you might be interested in becoming my patron for the following year.<br/><br/>


If you are not already familiar with my work under the name Cabbibo, I doubt a simple letter will convince you. Rather I would like to take time to try explain why I believe you should help fund one experimental creator to make more VR content this year, be it me or another creator.<br/><br/>


However, if you find that you are still interested at the end of this letter, you can check out the full ‘pitch-deck’ I am sending out more publically at: <a target="_blank" href="http://cabbi.bo/fellowship/">cabbi.bo/fellowship</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>




There is a dearth of ‘good content’ in VR. It is its greatest weakness, and makes VR gimmicky, filled with hype, and unsustainable. Although I do think the AAA games and 360 Hollywood film world will come to fill the current void, I am still hesitant to call this ‘good content’.<br/><br/>


The medium is so new, so unexplored, we cannot even begin to claim what ‘good’ means.<br/><br/>


In this medium that is so radically unlike any medium before -- one that is so much more physical, so much more malleable -- we cannot be content with simple ‘immersion’. The purpose of the immersion, the location and language of the immersion, these nuanced details offer something more than simply transporting the viewer to a world that is oversaturated, that has cartoon clouds, bloodstained corridors, or lasers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>


The truth is that VR can do something much deeper, more transgressive than we before thought possible. It can physically displace, mentally confound, confuse. It can create not just mindless joy, but deep discomfort. Not the kind that you feel when you see a creepy zombie, but rather the kind when you meet your truest form, when you have to fully consider what it means to be present with yourself, alone, in completely alien world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>




The vast majority of people who put on Google Earth VR travel to their home before going anywhere else. Some never even make it to Antarctica, the Sahara, or the exact middle of the Pacific Ocean. <br/><br/>


Somehow, somewhere we decided to choose comfort. We decided to choose the familiar. VR can offer us so much more than we could ever imagine, but the top selling apps are still sword fighting games, violence. <br/><br/>


I refuse to believe that this is because we as humans aren’t curious. That we don’t want to investigate further, dig deeper, dream, dream, and dream again. I just think that we have not been given the space and opportunity to see exactly what our dreams might become. <br/><br/><br/><br/>


The problem with dreaming is that it requires freedom. Experimentation is at its heart a luxury, a privilege. To truly explore the unknown, to dream in the ether, we must be fully flexible, willing and capable of letting that unknown manifest in whichever way it desires. Unadulterated by deadlines, profit margins, or societal expectations.<br/><br/>


It is this opportunity I am asking you to give me. To be able to research, to dive headfirst into the unknown, to release experiment after experiment to the community, to show the beautiful moments in the firmament I discover, as well as the mistakes, the blunders that come with experimentation. It is not something that I ask lightly. It is not something I ask without knowing that I can truly push this medium forward. That I can take people to places they have not before experienced, that I show them not just antartica, but another universe. That I can stir the forgotten curiosity that lies sleeping inside each and every one of us. That I can begin to ask and answer questions that until now have been relegated to the ether.<br/><br/>


Where can this medium take us? What can we see that can never be seen before?<br/><br/>


What is it, twinkling out there, in the distant stars of our imagination?<br/><br/>`;
